        <h3 style="color: #bfcb75;">Coffee Beans</h3>
        <p style="font-size:14px">A coffee bean is a seed of the coffee plant, and is the source for coffee. It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry. Even though they are seeds, they are referred to as 'beans' because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits - coffee cherries or coffee berries - most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. This is called a "peaberry." The peaberry is more unusual occurring only between 10 and 15 percent of the time, and it's a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour than 'normal' coffee beans.[1] Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.[2].</p>

        <p style="font-size:14px">Coffeehouse and coffee shop are related terms for an establishment which primarily serves prepared coffee and other hot beverages. Café in continental Europe refers to a traditional type of coffeehouse, but elsewhere "cafe" may refer to a tea room, small and cheap restaurant (colloquially a "caff"), transport cafe, or other casual eating and drinking place. A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. As the name suggests, coffeehouses focus on providing coffee and tea as well as light snacks.</p>
